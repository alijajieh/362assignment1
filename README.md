[List any specific technical skills or concepts you learned during the project.]

I completely learned HTML from this video. One thing i was very proud of was being able to write a line in html where it allowed the link to be opened in a new tab.
Understanding the target="_blank" attribute allowed me to harness the power of user-friendly navigation and improved accessibility on my web pages. I want to continue to work on this project and enhance it as I conitnue to grow in my html and css career.Many of the other students portfolios gave me a lot of insipiration and I cannot wait to learn more.
